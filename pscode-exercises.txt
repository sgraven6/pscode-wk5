// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Prompt the user to enter a number
ask user for num	

// Check if the number is even or odd
	print num, "is even"
else
	print num, "is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// Initialize variables
totalSum = 0
smallest = infinity
largest = -infinity

// Loop to read in 5 separate numbers
for i = 1 to 5 do
    // Prompt the user to enter a number
    ask user for num[i]
    
    // Calculate total sum
    totalSum = totalSum + num[i]
    
    // Check for smallest number
    if num[i] < smallest then
        smallest = num[i]
    
    // Check for largest number
    if num[i] > largest then
        largest = num[i]

// Calculate average
average = totalSum / 5

// Print results
print "The average of the five numbers is:", average
print "The smallest number entered is:", smallest
print "The largest number entered is:", largest
